# CA314 - Assigment 2

### Andrew Finn - 18XXXXXX

### Extras

* Added PyDoc strings and HTML file
* Added a graph.draw_graph() method which will open a GUI of the current state of the Graph
* A requirements.txt file

### Notes

I assumed that all edge were bidirectional (if A->B then B->A) for all parts of the assigment
