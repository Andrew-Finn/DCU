def sol():
    # return 3 items
    #   1. length of the shortest path from the start to the goal
    #   2. the smallest integer factor which multiplied by the Manhattan heuristic causes A* to fail this search
    #   3. the length of the resulting non optimal path.
    # e.g.
    return 5, 208, 50143
