def sol():
# return a local optimim
#
# For a given goal position, the local optimum's children will all have a higher cost than the local optimum itself.
# That is, when you are at the local optimum, every move leads further from the solution.
#
# The greedy algorithm usually gets stuck at a local optimum.
#
# You should return a local optimum for your goal position.
# What's your goal's position? return None to find out.
