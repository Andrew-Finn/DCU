def sol():
    # For this exercise, you don't create a program, just return 3 items
    # What items? Three items
    #   1. length of the shortest path from the start to the goal (including the start and the goal)
    #   2. The number of searches that the breadth first search required to find the path
    #   3. The number of searches that A* with the Manhattan Heuristic required to find the path
    # e.g.
    return 5, 208, 50143  # Note that this is just three random integers ... you need to work out the correct result.
