# Assigment 1 -> Andrew Finn - 18XXXXXX

## Description

Overall the assigment has been quite interesting. Setting up Antlr was a project in itself.

However, IntelliJ has been a godsend, with automated syntax highlighting, error checking and ambiguity checks built in.
This made the repetitive and back and forth progress go a lot quicker than changes and fixes could be verified MUCH
quicker. IntelliJ also allowed me to easily specify the Antlr java jar as an external project dependency.

The assigment really drove home how easy ambiguity is grammars and how edge cases are hard to invision to easy to crop
up. For the purpose of this assigment I am assuming -0 is an invalid variable.

The CCAL Spec given as part of the assignment was very close to Antlr syntax. As such the main process was simply
converting the spec rules to Antlr syntax and dealing with the Antlr funkiness.

During the course of the assignment i also walked myself down more than a few self-inflicted issues, such as Antlr
variables being only made up of non Ascii characters, Copying symbols from spec directly gave funky characters instead
of the expected ones (-/minus in particular, debugged that one for far longer than I care to admit ended up started from
scratch till a classmate noticed the non-standard symbol ... Thanks, Adobe OCR!)
